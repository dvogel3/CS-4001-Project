Inspired by human imagination and ingenuity, autonomous vehicles encompass an entire class of technologically-driven, self-driving transportation mediums. This class includes self-driving cars, public transportation, like buses and taxis, and long-distance transport vehicles, like semi-trucks. This technology, seemingly pulled straight from an episode of The Jetsons, is no longer just science-fiction. Autonomous vehicles is a technology fervently under research, with promising case studies and technologies; some companies, for example Tesla, have even incorporated self-driving technology in vehicles on the market today, including the hardware necessary for when full self-driving is approved for mass consumers [1]. As of now, certain facets of self-driving technology is piloted in high-end vehicles in the form of "driver-assistance", which helps in lane detection, parking assistance, collision avoidance, and other detection systems that assist the driver. But it seems that fully autonomous vehicles will be here in no time!

While autonomous vehicles definitely inspire the "wow"-factor, there are implications that need to be considered before autonomous vehicles can be indoctrinated into our every day lives. We will explore a variety of different ethical dimensions that autonomous vehicles introduce. These are dimensions that need to be considered in order for all of us to benefit from autonomous vehicle technology. It's important to highlight that many of these ethical dimensions overlap with each other, as many implications are necessarily multi-dimensional.

# Social Implications
-----------

We begin by discussing the social implications that autonomous vehicles can have on society. Specifically, we focus on the human-computer/human-technology interaction that arises from the use of autonomous vehicles; we also highlight the human pyschological and emotional experience with autonomous vehicles, in terms of fear and trust. We will separate this portion between two topics: autonomous personal vehicles and autonomous public transportation.

### A sidenote on human trust and technology

Trust is the cornerstone of human society. Trust builds relationships, forms bonds, and allows us to work with individuals to accomplish challenging tasks. Introduce a non-human element that a human interacts with and a new meaning of trust has to be introduced. The human-technology trust relationship is varied, depending on the human user. For example, younger generation individuals, often deemed "digital natives" have grown up, or are currently growing up, in a technologically driven society - a world of laptops, smartphones, and upcoming self-driving cars; trust in technology seems inherent to the digital natives as they have been brought up in this environment. On the other hand, older generations of individuals, in general, are less receptive to technological advances because of a variety of different reasons, but primarily because of a lack of understanding; this lack of understanding engenders a distrustful attitude towards new technologies [2]. Thus, the conversation about human trust in technology is foundational to understanding the social implications of autonomous vehicles. In fact, trust is a "primary predictor of technology usage and a fundamental construct for understanding user perceptions of technology [3]".

### Personally owned vehicles

A big component of choosing a personally owned vehicle is the safety ratings. If autonomous vehicles become a new standard in the automotive industry, then the perception of trust in the technology driving the autonomous vehicle becomes paramount. As discussed above, trust is a deep psychological, foundational factor that humans must be able to build with technology in order to be willing to use it. Of course, not many people would want to get into a vehicle that is not safe, as humans are naturally self-preserving creatures. Therefore, the question rises: how much do humans trust self-driving technology when it comes to vehicles?

According to research, humans (even older humans) already trust self-driving technology quite a bit. Once humans experience self-driving themselves, trust actually increases even more [4]. A study with Tesla Autopilot, a self-driving technology, was conducted among participants to measure trust in self-driving technology. The results show that initial trust in the technology was surprisingly quite high, and increased even more as people experienced the technologies themselves [4]. The study also highlights that trust in this technology is also influenced by age, which reaches back to the brief discussion about "digital natives" and older generations.

Although trust was generally high among most individuals, there is still a lingering fear among users of self-driving cars, especially in the technology's safety and reliability in high-speed environments (like highways) or long-distance travel [4].

Studies like these may be crucial to engendering trust in self-driving personal cars. Communities that seek to adopt legislation in allowing self-driving autonomous vehicles might want to pursue information campaigns to educate people on the safety of autonomous vehicle technology, only after more extensive research is conducted.
