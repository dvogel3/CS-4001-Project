Inspired by human imagination and ingenuity, autonomous vehicles encompass an entire class of technologically-driven, self-driving transportation mediums. This class includes self-driving cars, public transportation, like buses and taxis, and long-distance transport vehicles, like semi-trucks. This technology, seemingly pulled straight from an episode of The Jetsons, is no longer just science-fiction. Autonomous vehicles is a technology fervently under research, with promising case studies and technologies; some companies, for example Tesla, have even incorporated self-driving technology in vehicles on the market today, including the hardware necessary for when full self-driving is approved for mass consumers [1]. As of now, certain facets of self-driving technology is piloted in high-end vehicles in the form of "driver-assistance", which helps in lane detection, parking assistance, collision avoidance, and other detection systems that assist the driver. But it seems that fully autonomous vehicles will be here in no time!

While autonomous vehicles definitely inspire the "wow"-factor, there are implications that need to be considered before autonomous vehicles can be indoctrinated into our every day lives. We will explore a variety of different ethical dimensions that autonomous vehicles introduce. These are dimensions that need to be considered in order for all of us to benefit from autonomous vehicle technology. It's important to highlight that many of these ethical dimensions overlap with each other, as many implications are necessarily multi-dimensional.

# Social Implications

We begin by discussing the social implications that autonomous vehicles can have on society. Specifically, we focus on the human-computer/human-technology interaction that arises from the use of autonomous vehicles; we also highlight the human pyschological and emotional experience with autonomous vehicles, in terms of fear and trust. We will separate this portion between two topics: autonomous personal vehicles and autonomous public transportation.

### A sidenote on human trust and technology

Trust is the cornerstone of human society. Trust builds relationships, forms bonds, and allows us to work with individuals to accomplish challenging tasks. Introduce a non-human element that a human interacts with and a new meaning of trust has to be introduced. The human-technology trust relationship is varied, depending on the human user. For example, younger generation individuals, often deemed "digital natives" have grown up, or are currently growing up, in a technologically driven society - a world of laptops, smartphones, and upcoming self-driving cars; trust in technology seems inherent to the digital natives as they have been brought up in this environment. On the other hand, older generations of individuals, in general, are less receptive to technological advances because of a variety of different reasons, but primarily because of a lack of understanding; this lack of understanding engenders a distrustful attitude towards new technologies [2]. Thus, the conversation about human trust in technology is foundational to understanding the social implications of autonomous vehicles. In fact, trust is a "primary predictor of technology usage and a fundamental construct for understanding user perceptions of technology [3]".

### Autonomous Personally-owned Vehicles

A big component of choosing a personally owned vehicle is the safety ratings. If autonomous vehicles become a new standard in the automotive industry, then the perception of trust in the technology driving the autonomous vehicle becomes paramount. As discussed above, trust is a deep psychological, foundational factor that humans must be able to build with technology in order to be willing to use it. Of course, not many people would want to get into a vehicle that is not safe, as humans are naturally self-preserving creatures. Therefore, the question rises: how much do humans trust self-driving technology when it comes to vehicles?

According to research, humans (even older humans) already trust self-driving technology quite a bit. Once humans experience self-driving themselves, trust actually increases even more [4]. A study with Tesla Autopilot, a self-driving technology, was conducted among participants to measure trust in self-driving technology. The results show that initial trust in the technology was surprisingly quite high, and increased even more as people experienced the technology themselves [4]. The study also highlights that trust in this technology is also influenced by age, which reaches back to the brief discussion about "digital natives" and older generations.

Although trust was generally high among most individuals, there is still a lingering fear among users of self-driving cars, especially concerning the technology's safety and reliability in high-speed environments (like highways) or long-distance travel [4].

Studies like these may be crucial to engendering trust in self-driving personal cars. Communities that seek to adopt legislation in allowing self-driving autonomous vehicles might want to pursue information campaigns to educate people on the safety of autonomous vehicle technology, after more extensive research is conducted. Communities will only be able to integrate self-driving vehicles once fear is dispelled and trust is built in the technology.


### Autonomous Public Transportation

In discussing autonomous public transportation, we look primarily at public buses. Using autonomous public buses is two-fold as well, in terms of social trust. There is social trust in the driving technology of the autonomous bus and there is a social trust that must exist among people that are actually using the bus. 

Trust in the self-driving technology is a similar discussion to engendering trust within autonomous personal vehicles. However, extra precaution should be taken when adopting self-driving technology in public buses. It's important to weigh the considerations of individuals who use the bus for daily transportation. If autonomous driving is implemented in buses without the consideration of the people that use the buses, a population might feel excluded from using the buses because of a lack of trust in the technology. An information campaign about the safety of autonomous vehicle technology should not be assumed to be accessible by communities that public buses typically serve (typically, lower-income, disadvantaged individuals and communities). A more deliberate campaign of information about self-driving buses would have to be incorporated so that disadvantaged and under-represented communities can become informed and voice concerns about the implementation of this technology, as they would be the primary stakeholders of this usage of the self-driving technology. 

In addition to the public trust in the technology driving the autonomous buses, we must also consider the social implications of human-human interactions on the public buses. In particular, we should discuss potential crime and violence among individuals utilizing a public bus. Before the implementation of autonomous buses, does the presence of an authoritative figure on the bus (i.e. a bus driver) deter or prevent crime? If the self-driving nature of a bus eliminates the need for a bus driver, how will human-human conflicts be managed and negotiated on buses; does this present another element of fear that could deter users from using the bus? A potential solution could be to have a bus driver on the bus to 1) ensure the technology is in proper working order, potentially stepping in, in case the self-driving technology fails, and 2) to prevent and deter crime on the bus, hopefully distilling fear of illegal or violent activities on buses. The input of communities who utilize public buses will again need to be weighed considerably, as to not affect the experience or accessibility of using public buses for transportation.

The elements of human emotion and experience is cornerstone to the implementation of autonomous vehicles in everyday life. It's imperative to understand the consequentialist perspective in this ethical dimension. The adoption of self-driving cars and self-driving public transportation can have positive and negative impacts, especially in regards to engendering trust (in the case of developing awareness for the technology) or potentially engendering fear (such as in public buses because of lack of some authoritarian or lawful figure). The social and human experience are some of the most important set of implications to consider on the discussion of autonomous vehicles.


# Economic Implications

### Infrastructure

The next ethical dimension we need to explore is the economic implications that autonomous vehicles will have on society. According to research conducted by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), US infrastructure could not support nor maintain autonomous vehicle usage on its roads and bridges, due to a lack of infrastructure investments and upgrades. As of 2017, the ASCE estimated that the United States would require $4.59 trillion in order to improve failing or deficient infrastructure [5]. Only once these deficits are corrected could US infrastructure support mass autonomous vehicle implementation across the country.

Even implemented at the community level, communities would need to invest a significant amount of money to improve their infrastructure to the level required to support autonomous vehicles. Like the federal government, many communities result to tax increases, tolls, or other fees in order to raise the money they need for this infrastructure investment [6]. However, increasing taxes to support improving infrastructure will increase the financial burden on economically disadvantaged communities and individuals. Improving infrastructure would need to be approached from an equitable position, as only improving the infrastructure to allow the usage of autonomous vehicles would only benfit those who have access to autonomous vehicles, in which a majority of disadvantaged communities do not have access. Consequently, taxes increased for communities who don't necessarily stand to benefit from specific infrastructure improvements leads to unwarranted financial burden. Instead, it's imperative that, if a community decides to invest in infrastructure for autonomous vehicles, it invests in infrastructure in an equitable way - invest in infrastructure in disadvantaged commmunities (whose communities are typically suffering from a lack of infrastructure investment) first, while also improving infrastructure for autonomous vehicle usage within the community. This will serve the populaton that has the means to utilize personally owned autonomous vehicles, but will also pave the way to have autonomous buses and public transportation serve underprivileged communities, when infrastructure improvements in their communities is complete. If infrastructure investment is not allocated in an equitable way, it will only lead to increased social and economical stratification between priviledged and underpriviledged communities.

### Public Transportation Costs

With the advent of self-driving technology, public transportation will likely be a sector recipient of government funded self-driving technology, to increase the efficiency of public transportation within a community [7]. However, taking a consequentialist perspective, this may not be a good way forward. Self-driving technology in public transportation will defer technology upgrade costs to users of public transportation. In the case of autonomous public buses, bus fares would most likely increase by a significant amount to offset the technology upgrade. This creates an economic barrier for primary users of public buses because more often than not, these primary users are already economically disadvantaged. Deontologically speaking, this increase in price (however modest it is) hurts financially-unstable individuals. A way forward would be to have some sort of federal subsidy that helps cover the gap in public bus transportation price, to maintain the current price so that it does not affect those who rely on the bus as their main mode of transportation.

### Potential Job Loss

Another key economic implication of autonomous vehicles is job loss - in particular, this could affect truck drivers, bus drivers, taxi driver, and other jobs that rely on transportation (maybe not quite airplanes). In particular, this greatly affects the trucking industry. As autonomous vehicles becomes more prevalent, mass numbers of truckers will no longer be needed, resulting in millions of lost jobs for truckers [8]. The truckers that do remain will primarily be kept around for truck maintenance, journey logging, and other administrative needs dealing with transportation of goods. Consequently,
