Inspired by human imagination and ingenuity, autonomous vehicles encompass an entire class of technologically-driven, self-driving transportation mediums. This class includes self-driving cars, public transportation, like buses and taxis, and long-distance transport vehicles, like semi-trucks. This technology, seemingly pulled straight from an episode of The Jetsons, is no longer just science-fiction. Autonomous vehicles is a technology fervently under research, with promising case studies and technologies; some companies, for example Tesla, have even incorporated self-driving technology in vehicles on the market today, including the hardware necessary for when full self-driving is approved for mass consumers [1]. As of now, certain facets of self-driving technology is piloted in high-end vehicles in the form of "driver-assistance", which helps in lane detection, parking assistance, collision avoidance, and other detection systems that assist the driver. But it seems that fully autonomous vehicles will be here in no time!

While autonomous vehicles definitely inspire the "wow"-factor, there are implications that need to be considered before autonomous vehicles can be indoctrinated into our every day lives. We will explore a variety of different ethical dimensions that autonomous vehicles introduce. These are dimensions that need to be considered in order for all of us to benefit from autonomous vehicle technology.
