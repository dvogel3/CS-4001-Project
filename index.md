Inspired by human imagination and ingenuity, autonomous vehicles encompass an entire class of technologically-driven, self-driving transportation mediums. This class includes self-driving cars, public transportation, like buses and taxis, and long-distance transport vehicles, like semi-trucks. This technology, seemingly pulled straight from an episode of The Jetsons, is no longer just science-fiction. Autonomous vehicles is a technology fervently under research, with promising case studies and pieces of technology; some companies, for example Tesla, have even incorporated self-driving technology in vehicles on the market today, including the hardware necessary for when full self-driving is approved for mass consumers.
